# inverted-pendulum

## Objective

Balance an inverted pendulum by moving a cart attached to a belt/pulley system driven by a Pittman 14203 DC brushed motor. A Real Time Operating System (RTOS) using C++ is implemented on a custom microcontroller using a XMEGA128A4U. The hardware consists of an 80/20 frame, milled aluminum components, belts/pulleys, limit switches, encoder for the pendulum, encoder for the motor, and a linear bearing track and pillow block.
